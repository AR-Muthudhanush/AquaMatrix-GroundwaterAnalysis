# ðŸŒŠ AquaMatrix: Groundwater Analysis Network

## ðŸ“œ Abstract
The "AquaMatrix: Groundwater Analysis Network" project focuses on analyzing groundwater quality and availability across India using the Atal_Jal_Disclosed_Ground_Water_Level dataset from 2015 to 2022, sourced from [data.gov.in](https://data.gov.in/). This dataset includes comprehensive information on groundwater levels measured before and after monsoon seasons across various states, districts, and aquifers. Through temporal and geospatial analysis, the project aims to identify trends, seasonal variations, and regional disparities in groundwater levels. The analyses help pinpoint regions requiring immediate intervention for sustainable groundwater management and support informed decision-making for policymakers. Ultimately, this project underscores the necessity of continuous monitoring and proactive measures to ensure the long-term availability of groundwater resources in vulnerable areas.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
To get started with the AquaMatrix project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/aquamatrix.git
   cd aquamatrix
   ```
   
2. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Open and run the `Atal_Jal.ipynb` notebook from the repository to start data analysis and visualization.

3. **Data Setup**:
   - Download the dataset from [data.gov.in](https://data.gov.in/).
   - The cleaned dataset is provided in the repository under the filename `Atal_Jal_disclosed_ground_water.csv`.

## ðŸ“Š Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Load the dataset and preprocess it to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize the data if necessary.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Perform EDA to understand the data distribution, identify patterns, and discover insights. This includes analyzing trends over time, regional disparities, and seasonal variations in groundwater levels.

3. **Model Training and Prediction**:
   - Train the predictive model on historical data and use it to predict groundwater levels for given years.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Visualize the predicted groundwater levels for pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons to compare and contrast the seasonal variations.

## ðŸ¤– Prediction Model
The prediction model uses a GradientBoosting Regressor approach to predict groundwater levels. This model has been trained on historical data and has shown an accuracy of 80%, demonstrating improved accuracy compared to existing models. The predictions are legitimate and reflective of real-world trends.

## ðŸ“ˆ Results and Analysis
The analysis includes detailed insights into the changes in groundwater levels over the years, highlighting regions with significant groundwater depletion or recharge. It also provides a comparison of pre-monsoon and post-monsoon groundwater levels, demonstrating the seasonal impact on water availability.
